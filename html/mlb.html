<h5>Anthony Rizzo Honored in Hometown</h5>
<p>
 When Anthony Rizzo hosted his first Walk-Off for Cancer in 2012, the Cubs' first baseman was hoping to raise $30,000, and they <br />
 totaled $100,000. On Sunday, the Anthony Rizzo Family Foundation held its fifth annual five-kilometer walk, and they had raised <br />
 more than $500,000 before anyone took a step at Pine Trails Park. Sunday was officially Anthony Rizzo Appreciation Day in both <br />
 Parkland and in Broward County. Former Parkland mayor and current county commissioner Michael Udine declared the holiday in Broward <br />
 County in honor of the World Series champ.<br /><br />
 "Anthony Rizzo is a hometown hero with a big heart," Udine said. "Through his event, he's raised more than $2.5 million for cancer <br />
 research and to assist families and children battling cancer in Broward County."<br />

<h5>Giolito Excited To Join Sox</h5>
<p>
A few moments existed on Monday when Lucas Giolito thought the White Sox stood as his next pitching destination as part of a high-level<br /> 
trade for Chris Sale. Such is the world of social media, especially at the Winter Meetings. Giolito ended up with the White Sox, but as <br /> 
part of a four-player trade Wednesday involving outfielder Adam Eaton going to the Nationals. The 22-year-old right-hander joins seven<br /> 
other prospects as part of the rebuild of all rebuilds -- or at least it looks that way after two trades by general manager Rick Hahn.<br />
