<h2>Team Bio</h2>
</div>
<p>
The Chicago Bears are a professional American football team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Bears compete in the National<br />
Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. The Bears have <br />
won nine NFL Championships and one Super Bowl and hold the NFL record for the most enshrinees in the Pro Football Hall of <br />
Fame and the most retired jersey numbers. The Bears have also recorded more regular season and overall victories than any <br />
other NFL franchise. The franchise was founded in Decatur, Illinois, in 1919, and moved to Chicago in 1921. It is one of <br />
only two remaining franchises from the NFL's founding (along with the Arizona Cardinals, which was originally also in Chicago). <br />
The team played home games at Wrigley Field on Chicago's North Side through the 1970 season; they now play at Soldier Field on <br />
the Near South Side, next to Lake Michigan. The Bears have a long-standing rivalry with the Green Bay Packers.<br />

<h5>Bears Fall To Lions</h5>
<p>
The Bears rallied once Sunday at Ford Field, but they were unable to complete a second comeback with the game on the line in the <br />
final seconds. The Lions escaped with a 20-17 victory when Joshua Bellamy failed to hang onto Matt Barkley's pass over the middle <br />
on fourth-and-11 from the Detroit 44 with :13 to play. It appeared that the ball hit Bellamy's right shoulder while his left arm <br />
was tangled with cornerback Darius Slay. The Bears seemingly were in position to at least tie the game when they marched to the <br />
Lions' 43 with :58 remaining. But killer holding penalties on back-to-back plays against left tackle Charles Leno Jr. and right <br />
guard Ted Larsen wiped out clutch Barkley completions of 27 yards to Cameron Meredith to the 16 and 23 yards to Daniel Braverman <br />
to the 30.<br />
