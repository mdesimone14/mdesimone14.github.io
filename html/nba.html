<h2>Team Bio</h2>
</div>
<p>
The Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team based in Chicago. The Bulls compete in the National Basketball Association <br />
NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division. The team was founded on January 16, 1966. The team plays its <br />
home games at the United Center, an arena shared with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Bulls saw their <br />
greatest success during the 1990s. They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six NBA championships between <br />
1991 and 1998 with two three-peats. All six championship teams were led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and coach Phil <br />
Jackson. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships and never lose an NBA Finals series in their history.<br />

<h5>Bulls Squeak Out A Win Over Heat</h5>
<p>
The Heat hasn’t been on much this season, on the street, in the arena or pretty much anywhere, certainly not since Dwyane Wade made <br />
his break to sign with the Bulls. But it turned out to be no day at the beach Saturday as Miami made the Bulls sweat to the last <br />
seconds of a hotly contested game won by the Bulls 105-100. So the Bulls, perhaps predictably, played another of those games in which <br />
they think they’re the Bulls of the 90s. Or the Heat of 2012 and 2013. You know, when they can toss their socks onto the floor and walk <br />
away with an easy victory because of their dominance. Instead, the Bulls had to strain to the last seconds, a Heat mixup falling into <br />
the hands of Jimmy Butler with 2.9 seconds left, thus thwarting a potential Miami shot to send the game into overtime.<br />
